<h1><center>SUNS' CHRIS PAUL "OUT" FOR SECOND GAME OF WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS<center></h1>
	<hr />
<h3><i>The Suns' Chris Paul will not be playing in Tuesday's game, the second game of the Western Conference finals, according to the NBA.</i></h3>
<center><img src="https://www.yardbarker.com/media/3/2/32b09d06610b4035bebe19748e9bedd2e2bd1e45/thumb_16x9/chris-paul-takes-shot-giannis-free-throws.jpg?v=1" alt="Chris Paul" width="600" height="450" /></center>
<h4>Paul entered the NBA's COVID-19 "health and safety protocols" last week and was sidelined for an "idefinite period of time." It's not clear if he's vaccinated or if he may have to isolate for some time if he tests positive. The official injury report lists him as "out" for the game. He already sat out Sunday's Game 1.</h4>
<h4>The last time the Phoenix Suns were in the Western Conference Finals was 2010. They've also won the Conference title in 1976 and 1993, but the team has yet to win the championship.</h4>
<h4>Paul (36), has been essential to the Suns all seasons, including when they defeated the L.A. Lakers in Round 1, and then swept the Denver Nuggets in Round 2.</h4>
<h4>This will be CP3's second time in the Western Conference Finals. He went in 2018 with the Houston Rockets, but an injury kept him out of games 6 and 7.</h4>
